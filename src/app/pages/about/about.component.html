        <p>Anyone with a Tezos wallet can create or support a crowdfunding campaign easily. No account, just a wallet. 
          When a campaign is created, a new smart contract is deployed. This smart contract is yours and the platform has 
          no control over it, which means only you can make decisions about your campaign - <b>a truly decentralized
          crowdfunding campaign without intermediaries.</b>
        </p>
    
        <p>Funds are immediately transferred from the supporter wallet to the campaign owner wallet and there is no commission per transaction.
          As a campaign owner, you only need to transfer 3<img class="tezos-symbol"> upon campaign creation - this is to prevent spam campaigns and to support
          the platform costs.

          This will deploy a new contract for your campaign, where all the needed info will be stored. You'll need to connect

        <p>Everytime a user funds your campaign, the funds will be immediately transfered to the wallet that created the campaign.
          If you lost access to your wallet, you won't be able to access those funds and there is no way of closing the campaign
          to prevent users from funding it further. Please make sure you have your wallet secured.
